# TODO - Form

1. Clean up ssh-manager
Though functional it looks horrendeous.

2. Comb though and implement source and export 
   still learning how to use bash and part way though
   I figured out that Things that USE a globar variable
   can be subshelled alongside export while things that 
   CHANGE global variable (with the intention of preservation)
   can be SOURCED

3. Reconfigure the prompts for visual appeal
Shit looks aids bro

# TODO - Function
1. bugfix false values
i've only tested with values i know were proper, sans one
which blew shit sky high, maybe have some automated testing
and logging, which reminds me

2. implement some debugging support
fuck how do i even do that.
